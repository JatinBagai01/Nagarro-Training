                    Odin Borson the All-Father is King of Asgard and protector of the Ten Realms. He is a member
                    of the race known as the Asgardians, a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of
                    Asgard, the Realm Eternal. During the ancient times, he was worshiped as the god of wisdom
                    by the humans known as Vikings on Midgard. He is considered the wisest and the most powerful of the
                    Asgardians. He is also a member of the Council of Godheads battling all threats against the
                    Pantheons of Earth. Odin is a name that is respected and feared throughout the Universe. He
                    is the son of Bor and Bestla, brother of Vili, Ve, Cul and husband of Freyja. He has fathered many
                    children such as Vidar, Balder and of course the Mighty Thor his son and heir. He hoped to bring
                    peace to all the realms and during one of the great battle against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim he
                    defeated their leader Laufey. In the process he found his abandoned son Loki and adopted him as his
                    own and hoped he would one day bring peace to their two realms.
